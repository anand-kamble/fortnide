# A competetive web game

## By Anand Kamble

This project is under development.

Fortnide is a project where I am trying to create a game similar to [Fortnite](https://www.fortnite.com/) which can run on the browser. Obviously, I cannot make it with all the features like the original fornite (since I'm not [Epic Games](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/home)) but I will be implementing the essential features like building, shooting, emotes,and maybe a car.

The project is divided into multiple parts including

[Core](./src/core/README.md)

[Logger](./src/Logger/)

[UI](./src/UI/)
